Use triple quotes(""") for multiline comments


Operators I struggled on:
- "%" operator is the modulus operator, which divides the numbers and outputs the remainders
- "//" operator is the floor division operator, which rounds down to the nearest whole number after dividing


To find datatype, use print(type())


Datatypes I struggled on:
- [ , , , ] = list (ordered collection which allows to store different data type items)
- {x:y} = dictionary (unordered collection of data in a key value pair format)
- ( , , , ) = tuple (ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples can not be modified once they are created. They are immutable)
- { , , , } = set (collection of data types similar to list and tuple. Unlike list and tuple, set is not an ordered collection of items. Like in Mathematics, set in Python stores only unique items)
